The Pax Romana Project aims at bringing the ancient times of Europe into Crusader Kings 3.

## Start Date
The first start date we are working on is 263 BCE, just a year before the start of the first Punic War. In this period, the player will have the possibility to start the war or avoid it playing as Carthage, Rome or the city-state of Messana. Meanwhile, in the east, Alexander the Great's once mighty empire is now in turmoil, and all the successor kingdoms are in an almost constant war to consolidate domain. Will anyone be able to reconquer the land of Alexander? Or will the dream of the Makédonian empire be shattered once and for all?

## New Govern Types
The first thing we wanted to flash out are the new govern types. We decided to make four:
- Tribal Governments
> Tribal governments do not have any particular different mechanics, except the fact that they can’t have a title which tier is higher than duchy tier, which is in common with the City-State governments.

- City-States
> City-States governments have access to the League system in the “realm tab”. This system allows City-States to ally with other City-States not already in a League. Every League has a leader which can decide who can enter, who leaves and to disband the League if he is the only member. He can also be usurped if the Auctoritas is too low.
> Every member contributes 10% of his monthly income to the League’s Funds, which members can use in case of need, but with thrift, as taking loans gives the other members a worse reputation of you.
> Any member can decide autonomously to leave the League, but this will anger the leader, who can decide to attack the ex-member and forcefully reintegrate him into the league. 

- Dynastic
> Dynastic governments have access to the Dynastic Factions system. Every Dynastic ruler will have to share his power with three important major factions: the Army, the Nobles and the Citizens. They all have a certain happiness value, which can be between 0 and 100, starting from 50.
> Every faction has its leader chosen between the realm’s vassal based on their martial skill for the Army, stewardship skill for the Nobles and Diplomacy skill for the Citizens. Any vassal can be the leader of multiple factions.
> Once in a while, an event will pop-up, which will make you decide between the happiness of two or more different factions. Generally good answers (which make everyone happy) can be chosen only if you have a high amount of Auctoritas.
> With enough gold and prestige (and if you have a lot of Auctoritas) you can take Actions which will increase the Faction’s happiness. 
> If a faction’s happiness gets equal or lower than 10%, then the faction starts revolting, making the realm suffer heavy debuffs. Not only that, the faction leader is likely to revolt, making him the new ruler of the kingdom if the revolt succeeds.

- Res Publica
> Right now we have not already started working on it, but the plan is roughly to simulate a gamified version of the Roman Republic System.

## Other changes
The amount of changes is immeasurable! New MAAs, new Cultures and new Religions! A different map with different rulers, a new naval warfare mechanic is in plans and new flavours! We are also thinking about more start dates!
Keep in contact and prepare to start your own Pax Romana!
