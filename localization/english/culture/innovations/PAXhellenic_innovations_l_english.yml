 innovation_pteruges: "Pteruges"
 innovation_pteruges_desc: "One pteruge is just a strip of fabric, useless alone, but multiple pteruges combined together form an armor, a cuirass. In the same way one single man fighting alone, even if well trained, is useless, but a whole unit of them is going to form an impenetrable wall."
 innovation_human_hunting_machines: "Human Hunting Machines"
 innovation_human_hunting_machines_desc: "Silent giant killers, the roman took the greek Polybolos and made their own version: the Scorpio. This semi-stationary weapon can kill multiple people in a single shot from a long distance, just be careful and do not aim it at your own men." 
 innovation_stone_walls: "Stone Walls"
 innovation_stone_walls_desc: "Try to destroy a wooden wall and with the right tools you are done in a couple of minutes. Try that again with a stone wall. It is not that is now, isn't it?"
 innovation_seric_steel: "Seric Steel"
 innovation_seric_steel_desc: "Ferrite, pearlite, sulfur, arsenic, iron, all together to exhibit unique patterns. Every single blackend line telling a story of molecules fusing together to form something new, more solid than before, stronger, which makes the job of exterminating other humans easier. You can call it "Wootz Steel", the Indians invented it, but we call it "Seric Steel"."
 innovation_pilum: "Pilum"
 innovation_pilum_desc: "No need to get close, even if you do not know how to use a bow, you probably know how to throw objects. Before engaging in combat, throw this: a Pilum. The Pilum is a spear made it in a way that not only will it stick into the soft meat of humans, but can pass through wood too, making their shields almost useless."
 innovation_corvus: "Corvus"
 innovation_corvus_desc: "Triremes are an extremely good and effective design to travel through water, but when it comes to fighting against other Triremes, stuff becomes difficult. Your only possibility is to use a bow, but good luck steading your aim while the waves are continually hitting your feet, making you wobble around constantly. What if there was a way to actually transform a naval battle in a normal land battle? That is what Corvus are made for: big bridges mounted onto the bow of the boats with a sharp metallic tooth on their belly, ready to spring down on other triremes when they get close, letting your men board your enemies."
 innovation_chainmail: "Chainmail"
 innovation_chainmail_desc: "Small little metallic rings chained together, so small and so tightly that they form an impenetrable and light defense for your body. No, before you ask, arrow heads can't fit through the holes and slashing will result into nothing fot the enemy."
 innovation_oplon: "Oplon"
 innovation_oplon_desc: "Picture this: an intricate dance of sinew and steel, where the ancient craft of armory meets the brutality of warfare. The Oplon isn't just a shield; it's the embodiment of survival and strategy. In the phalanx, it's your lifeline, locking with others to form an impenetrable wall that transforms the tide of battle, turning the wielder into an unstoppable force."
 innovation_military_training: "Military Training"
 innovation_military_training_desc: "War is not won by numbers alone, but by discipline, precision, and the relentless grind of preparation. Imagine raw recruits, once mere farmers or craftsmen, transformed into a cohesive force, their movements synchronized like the gears of a war machine. This is the essence of Military Training: a ritual of endurance, repetition, and hardship. Days spent drilling in formation, nights practicing the art of the sword and spear, until muscle memory replaces hesitation with instinct. The chaos of battle becomes a symphony, each soldier a note in a deadly composition."
 
 # Civic
 innovation_dynasticism: "Dynasticism"
 innovation_dynasticism_desc: "Power flows not merely from the sword but through the bloodline, an unbroken chain linking the past to the future. This is Dynasticism: the art of securing a legacy through generations, where the throne is more than just a seat, but a symbol of continuity and stability. Alliances are forged not just by treaty, but by marriage, weaving a web of influence that spans empires. The Egyptians might speak of pharaohs as gods on Earth, but we understand Dynasticism as the true divine right: a lineage that binds the fates of the people to the destiny of the crown, ensuring that power endures through the ages."
 innovation_potestas_ad_populum: "Potestas ad Populum"
 innovation_potestas_ad_populum_desc: "Voices, anger, happiness, ideas, power, humanity. This is Potestas ad Populum: an awakening, a revolution that shifts the balance of authority from the crown to the citizens. Here, governance is no longer a birthright but a privilege earned through debate, vote, and the rule of law. The state becomes a Res Publica, where leaders are chosen not by bloodline, but by merit and the consent of the governed. Every voice shapes the future, and the people themselves become the architects of their own destiny."
 innovation_treadmills: "Treadmills"
 innovation_treadmills_desc: "The relentless turning of a massive wheel, powered not by wind or water, but by the steady, unyielding footsteps of men or beasts. This is the Treadmill: a marvel of engineering that transforms simple motion into the energy needed to drive mills, raise heavy loads, or even power siege engines. No longer are we at the mercy of nature's whims; with the Treadmill, we harness the strength of muscle to fuel the demands of industry and war. We see it as a symbol of ingenuity, a way to turn human and animal effort into the raw power that builds empires."
 innovation_archimedean_screw: "Archimedean Screw"
 innovation_archimedean_screw_desc: "Fields stretching out under the sun, but the soil is dry, and the crops are thirsty. Your people are struggling, praying for rain that never seems to come. But what if you could pull water from the depths below, using nothing more than a twist of the hand? The Archimedean Screw is here to turn your fortunes around. With this ingenious device, you can lift water from rivers and wells, sending it flowing through your fields, nourishing every plant, every seed. It's a simple, reliable tool that even the most inexperienced farmer can use. No more waiting on the whims of the skies: now, the power to bring life to your crops is in your hands.

 innovation_corynthian_columns: "Corinthian Columns" 
 innovation_corynthian_columns_desc: "There's something about a building that rises beyond function, something that speaks to the spirit of those who walk beneath its arches. The Corinthian Columns embody this ideal, where stone becomes art, and architecture becomes a reflection of the culture that built it. These columns aren't just there to hold up the roof; they're carved with the delicate elegance of acanthus leaves, capturing the beauty of nature in the permanence of stone. They tell a story of people who value not just strength, but grace; who believe that even the most functional structures should inspire. To stand in a hall lined with Corinthian Columns is to be reminded of the heights to which human creativity can ascend." 
 innovation_athenian_pottery: "Athenian Pottery"
 innovation_athenian_pottery_desc: "Not all stories are told with words. Some are painted, etched into clay, and fired in the kilns of Athens. Athenian Pottery is more than just vessels for oil or wine: it's a canvas for the tales of gods, heroes, and everyday life. Each pot is a glimpse into the soul of a culture that cherishes both beauty and utility. From the deep, black backgrounds to the vibrant figures that dance across the surface, these pots are more than just functional, they're an art form. When you hold a piece of Athenian Pottery, you hold a piece of history, a connection to the artists who shaped not just clay, but the very identity of a group of people."
 innovation_greek_surgeries: "Greek Surgeries"
 innovation_greek_surgeries_desc: "Sharp minds and sharper tools, that's the key to saving lives. In the bustling Agora, where ideas and philosophies collide, there's a new kind of healer at work. These aren't your average herbalists or soothsayers; no, these are the surgeons of Greece, wielding scalpels instead of scrolls. They dare to cut where others fear to tread, peeling back flesh to mend what's broken inside. It's not just bravery; it's a dance with the gods themselves, as they stitch together the torn fabric of life. But be warned, these innovations come at a cost, both in coin and in trust. For who would dare let a man slice them open, unless they believed in miracles? And yet, in the hands of these skilled practitioners, perhaps miracles are exactly what you'll get."

 # Culture and Regional
 innovation_steppe_raiders: "Steppe Raiders"
 innovation_steppe_raiders_innovation: "Windswept plains, endless horizons, and the thunder of hooves, this is the world of the Steppe Riders. Born in the saddle and raised by the wild, these warriors are more at home on horseback than on solid ground. Their steeds are not just animals, but extensions of themselves, swift and fierce, with a bond that goes beyond mere mastery. With bows drawn and spears at the ready, they move like the wind, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies before vanishing into the vastness of the steppe. To fight a Steppe Rider is to battle the very earth and sky, for they are as untamed as the land they call home. Harnessing this innovation means unleashing the fury of the steppe itself, turning your army into a force of nature that can't be caught or conquered. But remember, these riders are free spirits: try to bind them too tightly, and you might just lose more than you gain."
 innovation_makedonian_reform: "Makédonian Reform"
 innovation_makedonian_reform_desc: "Imagine a wall of steel, a forest of pikes stretching as far as the eye can see, unyielding and unstoppable. This is the power of the Makédonian Reform, the brainchild of Philip II. With the Sarissa, a pike so long it blots out the sun, the traditional phalanx has evolved into something more, something devastating. No longer will your soldiers fight as individuals, but as a single, impenetrable unit, where every man depends on the strength of his comrades. When the enemy charges, they find not men, but a thicket of death awaiting them, impossible to break and terrifying to behold. This innovation reshapes the battlefield, turning your army into a relentless force, a rolling juggernaut of iron and discipline. But beware, such power demands precision: one flaw in the line, and the whole formation could falter. Yet, when mastered, the Makédonian Reform makes you not just a leader of men, but a commander of legends, capable of conquering empires and etching your name into the annals of history." 
 innovation_seleucids_strenght: "Seleucid's Strenght"
 innovation_seleucids_strenght_desc: "Behold the might of the Seleucids, a dynasty forged in the fires of conquest, and now, they bring forth their ultimate weapon: the Silver Shield Pikemen. Clad in gleaming armor that reflects the sun's blinding rays, these warriors are not just soldiers, hey are the embodiment of strength, discipline, and Seleucid pride. With Sarissas that stretch to the heavens, they form an impenetrable phalanx, a living fortress that moves with the precision of a well-oiled machine. Each man in this elite unit is a veteran, a survivor of countless battles, their skill honed to perfection. When the Silver Shields take the field, the very ground trembles beneath their feet, and enemies know that their end is near. This innovation is more than just a military advancement; it's a declaration of supremacy. To wield the Seleucid's Strength is to command the finest pikemen ever seen, a force so powerful that even the bravest foes hesitate to challenge it. But remember, such elite soldiers come at a steep price—both in resources and in trust. Keep them close, treat them well, and they will be your unbreakable shield against all who dare oppose you."
 innovation_master_dog_trainers: "Master Dog Trainers"
 innovation_master_dog_trainers_desc: "In the heat of battle, a new terror emerges: Warhounds, bred for brutality and unleashed by their masters with lethal precision. These dogs are no ordinary creatures; they are living weapons, forged in the fires of relentless training and bound by an unbreakable bond with their handlers. When they charge, they become a blur of teeth and muscle, ripping through enemy ranks and sowing chaos wherever they go. The battlefield trembles at their approach, and even the most hardened soldiers hesitate, knowing that these hounds fight with a fury that only loyalty and love can inspire. To face them is to face the very embodiment of primal power, a force that turns the tide of war with every savage bite."
