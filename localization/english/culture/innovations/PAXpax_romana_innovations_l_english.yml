 innovation_lorica_segmentata: "Lorica Segmentata"
 innovation_lorica_segmentata_desc: "The Lorica Segmentata was a type of armour used by the Roman Army consisting of metal strips fashioned into circular stripped fastened into internal leather straps. This type of armour was shown to be effective, the iron plates it's composed of deflecting slashing and stabbing attacks while being lighter then chainmail armour like the Lorica Hamata. It's design also grants freedom of movement in the shoulders, which is ideal for aggressive, close quarters combat style of Roman infantry. However these advantages come at a cost, the process of manufacturing this armor is labour-intensive and the cost of maintaining this armor is higher then that of the Lorica Hamata."
 innovation_advanced_sieges: "Ballista"
 innovation_advanced_sieges_desc: "After the absorption of ancient Greek City states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC. Greek technology would start spreading throughout many areas of Roman influence, including their advantageous military advances such as the ballista. The ballista is a heavy missile weapon that can act as a siege weapon and an anti-personnel weapon.  It is able to hurl rocks great distances up to 500 yards to damage and destroy rampart walls, and has great accuracy with reports of ballistas individually picking off enemy soldiers. Roman General and Statesman, Julius Caesar is an example on how to effectively use the ballista. Using it in his first naval invasion of Britain to scare off the natives and in the battle of Alesia placed on towers with other soldiers armed with bows and slings."
 innovation_strong_walls: "Walled Cities"
 innovation_strong_walls_desc: "The Romans generally fortified their cities rather then building standalone forts, especially in areas which they felt they were vulnerable. These walls during peacetime would give a sense of comfort and security to the Roman citizens living inside those walls and acted as checkpoints controlling the flow of goods, people and animals in and out of the city. Gates in the walls also allowed city officials to collect taxes and tolls on goods entering or leaving the city. During wartime it would prevent the enemy from getting into the city easily, forcing them into a protracted siege where siege weaponry would need to be built to destroy the walls or gates or sappers would be used to mine under walls to weaken and collapse them."
 innovation_military_camps: "Castra"
 innovation_military_camps_desc: "War isn't won on the battlefield alone; it's won with thorough preperation and logistics. The Roman Castra, is designed to house and protect soldiers alongside their equipment and supplies when they were on the march. Regulation within the Roman Army states that a major army in the field was to retire to a properly constructed Castra every day. In these Castra, soldiers undergo rigorous training two times a day in the morning and afternoon in multiple fields such as archery, spear-throwing and swordsmanship against posts stuck in the ground including a 32 or 68 kilometre jog with all of their equipment. These Castra didn't act merely as just a training and logistics camp but also as a fort, the Castrum being placed within the vallum which consists of trenches dug around the castra, the dug up soil formed into the rampart and a palisade of stakes erected making it no easy task for an enemy to overrun the Castra."
 innovation_iron_shield_boss: "Caltrops"
 innovation_iron_shield_boss_desc: "Caltrops known to the Romans as tribulus is an areal denial weapon made up of usually four sharp nails or spines arranged in a manner such that, the caltrop is resting on three with the fourth spike or nail facing upright. Caltrops were a part of defences meant to slow down the advance of troops, especially calvary, horse-drawn chariots and war elephants. They proved effective in this role, when strewn across a field either wounding or killing horses rendering both calvary and chariots useless on the battlefield nullifying any calvary advantage that the enemy the Romans were facing might have had such as Mithradates VI of Pontus."
 innovation_scutum: "Scutum"
 innovation_scutum_desc: "The Scutum is a large rectangular curved shield made out from three sheets of wood glued together and covered with canvas and leather, which facilitaed the survival and protection of many Romans providing a formidable defense with it's large size and width covering them entirely making it unlikely to be hit by missiles or in hand to hand combat. The metal boss placed in the centre of the Scutum also allowed it to be used as an auxiliary punching weapon, allowing Roman soldiers to bash opponents with their shield. The shape of the Scutum allowed pack formations of Legionaires to overlap their shields to provide an effective barrier against missile projectiles. One of the most famous examples of this is the testudo formation which added legionaires holding shields from above to protect the formation from descending projectiles."
 innovation_martial_composure: "Military Discipline"
 innovation_martial_composure_desc: "In the heat of battle, where fear and chaos threaten to consume even the bravest, the true strength of a soldier is revealed, not in raw power, but in unshakable discipline. This is what allows armies to gain an advantage over another, discipline. While the enemies cheer, boast and taunt a disciplined soldier stands resolute, his lack of reaction and total silence striking fear into the enemy, his mind as sharp as his blade, his movements calculated and precise. There's no panic, no hesitation, only the calm, methodical execution of strategy. In the face of overwhelming odds, it is this discipline that turns the tide of battle allowing the Romans to embark on their path to becoming the dominant power in the mediterranean."
 innovation_horse_breeders: "Horse Breeders"
 innovation_horse_breeders_desc: "On the battlefield, calvary is an essential component to any army. Light calvary for reconaissance, screening and skirmishing, heavy calvary for decisive shock attacks. But for a calvaryman to perform his job well he doesn't need only training and equipment he needs a good horse and horse breeders help to achieve that. Sysetematic methods of horse breeding in cultures such as Rome allowed them to produce fast and strong horses for military and sporting purposes. Through generations of careful selection and breeding, they produce steeds that are not just fast, but strong, resilient, and utterly dependable in the chaos of battle. These horses are bred for endurance, able to carry a rider through the fiercest engagements without faltering. With the expertise of Horse Breeders, cavalry is able to function effectively and is able to play their decisive role on the battlefield."

 innovation_arenas: "Amphitheatre"
 innovation_arenas_desc: "Amphitheatres are large, circular or oval open-air venues with tiered seatings. These towering structures are more than mere buildings, they are the grand stages where skilled warriors, majestic beasts, and the strongest champions engage in gladiator combat, the killing of wild animals and executions. Designed to captivate and awe, Amphitheatres are architectural marvels, towering monuments to Roman culture and the celebration of strength. Every stone, every archway, is crafted to perfection, creating an environment where thousands can gather to be provided thrilling distractions from the daily hardships of life. Here, in these communal spaces, legends are forged, and attention is diverted from political or social greviances for gladitorial combat."
 innovation_aeolipile: "Treadwheel crane"
 innovation_aeolipile_desc: "In the past, the process of building the pyramids required 50 men to push a 2.5 ton stone up a ramp, now it only requires 4 with the treadwheel crane to move that stone. The Treadwheel Crane, a marvel of ancient engineering, has greatly reduced the time taken in the building of structures such as castles and churches being able to lift up weights up to 6000 kilograms. This curious device, a simple yet profound mechanism, works by having someone walk on the treadwheel when the load has been affixed to the pallet, the rope attached to a pulley is turned onto a spindle by the rotation of the wheel, allowing the crane to hoist or lower the affixed load on the pallet. The Threadwheel crane will greatly help in the efficiency and time taken for construction projects."
 innovation_noria: "Noria"
 innovation_noria_desc: "A machine that harnesses the power from the flow of a river, the Noria stands as a testament to the ingenuity of ancient engineers. This water wheel, driven by the current of a river, elevates water from its lower elevations to higher elevations into aqueducts to irrigate fields and supply towns with water. The Noria allows barren landscapes to be transformed into thriving farmland, ensuring that water can be transported to ensure tows and fields recieve sufficient water even in the driest of regions. Its continuous, rhythmic motion is a lifeline for many towns and fields. With the Noria, water can be sent to towns and fields for agriculture, domestic use and into aqueducts for long distances sustaining civilizations and ensuring prosperity for communities."
 innovation_paved_roads: "Roman Concrete"
 innovation_paved_roads_desc: "Roman Concrete was based on hydraulic-setting cement added to an aggregate, Roman Concrete was said to be versatile and durable it's strength enhanced by the incorporation of pozzolanic ash. This meticulously crafted concrete prevented the spreading of cracks within the concrete, was waterproof and was designed to resist earthquakes as the Italian peninsula was quite to prone to them. Roman Concrete is built to last, a durable surface that withstands the wear of time and the elements. They enabled the construction of Rome's most magnificent monuments such as the Pantheon and harbours in the Mediterranean Sea. With Roman Concrete, buildings were stronger, durable and resistant to natural disasters allowing for Roman Concrete to be used in projects all across the Empire."

Warmth, once a luxury confined to the hearth, becomes an all-encompassing comfort with the advent of the Hypocaust system. This ingenious system channels heat beneath floors and through walls, enveloping entire spaces in a steady, welcoming warmth. No longer must one huddle close to a single fire, every room, every corner, is bathed in even, consistent heat. The brilliance of this design lies in its simplicity: heated air or water flows through a network of channels, distributing warmth efficiently and effectively throughout a building. The Hypocaust system allows people to live and thrive in comfort regardless of the how cold the weather is outside."
 innovation_governance_substratum: "Governance Substrarum"
 innovation_governance_substratum_desc: "For a government to run smoothly, the decentralization of power is required. While the Emperor held supreme authority much of the everyday governance was handed off to local leaders, provincial governers and military commanders. This structure and system of governance within the Roman Empire that held it together, ensuring that the empire could manage vast territories without overloading the central government and allowing local officials to handle issues practically without approval required from Rome. This approach empowers regions to manage their own affairs while remaining connected to a larger, unified state."
