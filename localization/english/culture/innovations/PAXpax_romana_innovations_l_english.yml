 innovation_lorica_segmentata: "Lorica Segmentata"
 innovation_lorica_segmentata_desc: "The Lorica Segmentata was a type of armour used by the Roman Army consisting of metal strips fashioned into circular stripped fastened into internal leather straps. This type of armour was shown to be effective, the iron plates it's composed of deflecting slashing and stabbing attacks while being lighter then chainmail armour like the Lorica Hamata. It's design also grants freedom of movement in the shoulders, which is ideal for aggressive, close quarters combat style of Roman infantry. However these advantages come at a cost, the process of manufacturing this armor is labour-intensive and the cost of maintaining this armor is higher then that of the Lorica Hamata."
 innovation_advanced_sieges: "Ballista"
 innovation_advanced_sieges_desc: "After the absorption of ancient Greek City states into the Roman Republic in 146 BC. Greek technology would start spreading throughout many areas of Roman influence, including their advantageous military advances such as the ballista. The ballista is a heavy missile weapon that can act as a siege weapon and an anti-personnel weapon.  It is able to hurl rocks great distances up to 500 yards to damage and destroy rampart walls, and has great accuracy with reports of ballistas individually picking off enemy soldiers. Roman General and Statesman, Julius Caesar is an example on how to effectively use the ballista. Using it in his first naval invasion of Britain to scare off the natives and in the battle of Alesia placed on towers with other soldiers armed with bows and slings."
 innovation_strong_walls: "Walled Cities"
 innovation_strong_walls_desc: "The Romans generally fortified their cities rather then building standalone forts, especially in areas which they felt they were vulnerable. These walls during peacetime would give a sense of comfort and security to the Roman citizens living inside those walls and acted as checkpoints controlling the flow of goods, people and animals in and out of the city. Gates in the walls also allowed city officials to collect taxes and tolls on goods entering or leaving the city. During wartime it would prevent the enemy from getting into the city easily, forcing them into a protracted siege where siege weaponry would need to be built to destroy the walls or gates or sappers would be used to mine under walls to weaken and collapse them."
 innovation_military_camps: "Castra"
 innovation_military_camps_desc: "War isn't won on the battlefield alone; it's won with thorough preperation and logistics. The Roman Castra, is designed to house and protect soldiers alongside their equipment and supplies when they were on the march. Regulation within the Roman Army states that a major army in the field was to retire to a properly constructed Castra every day. In these Castra, soldiers undergo rigorous training two times a day in the morning and afternoon in multiple fields such as archery, spear-throwing and swordsmanship against posts stuck in the ground including a 32 or 68 kilometre jog with all of their equipment. These Castra didn't act merely as just a training and logistics camp but also as a fort, the Castrum being placed within the vallum which consists of trenches dug around the castra, the dug up soil formed into the rampart and a palisade of stakes erected making it no easy task for an enemy to overrun the Castra."
 innovation_iron_shield_boss: "Caltrops"
 innovation_iron_shield_boss_desc: "Caltrops known to the Romans as tribulus is an areal denial weapon made up of usually four sharp nails or spines arranged in a manner such that, the caltrop is resting on three with the fourth spike or nail facing upright. Caltrops were a part of defences meant to slow down the advance of troops, especially calvary, horse-drawn chariots and war elephants. They proved effective in this role, when strewn across a field either wounding or killing horses rendering both calvary and chariots useless on the battlefield nullifying any calvary advantage that the enemy the Romans were facing might have had such as Mithradates VI of Pontus."
 innovation_scutum: "Scutum"
 innovation_scutum_desc: "The Scutum is a large rectangular curved shield made out from three sheets of wood glued together and covered with canvas and leather, which facilitaed the survival and protection of many Romans providing a formidable defense with it's large size and width covering them entirely making it unlikely to be hit by missiles or in hand to hand combat. The metal boss placed in the centre of the Scutum also allowed it to be used as an auxiliary punching weapon, allowing Roman soldiers to bash opponents with their shield. The shape of the Scutum allowed pack formations of Legionaires to overlap their shields to provide an effective barrier against missile projectiles. One of the most famous examples of this is the testudo formation which added legionaires holding shields from above to protect the formation from descending projectiles."
 innovation_martial_composure: "Military Discipline"
 innovation_martial_composure_desc: "In the heat of battle, where fear and chaos threaten to consume even the bravest, the true strength of a soldier is revealed, not in raw power, but in unshakable discipline. This is what allows armies to gain an advantage over another, discipline. While the enemies cheer, boast and taunt a disciplined soldier stands resolute, his lack of reaction and total silence striking fear into the enemy, his mind as sharp as his blade, his movements calculated and precise. There's no panic, no hesitation, only the calm, methodical execution of strategy. In the face of overwhelming odds, it is this discipline that turns the tide of battle allowing the Romans to embark on their path to becoming the dominant power in the mediterranean."
 innovation_horse_breeders: "Horse Breeders"
 innovation_horse_breeders_desc: "On the battlefield, calvary is an essential component to any army. Light calvary for reconaissance, screening and skirmishing, heavy calvary for decisive shock attacks. But for a calvaryman to perform his job well he doesn't need only training and equipment he needs a good horse and horse breeders help to achieve that. Sysetematic methods of horse breeding in cultures such as Rome allowed them to produce fast and strong horses for military and sporting purposes. Through generations of careful selection and breeding, they produce steeds that are not just fast, but strong, resilient, and utterly dependable in the chaos of battle. These horses are bred for endurance, able to carry a rider through the fiercest engagements without faltering. With the expertise of Horse Breeders, cavalry is able to function effectively and is able to play their decisive role on the battlefield."
