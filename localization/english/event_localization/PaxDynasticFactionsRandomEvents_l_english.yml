 ade.d.1: "As you exit through the doors of your villa, a group of civilians come running up to you. Practically out of breath, one need not the eyes of the Gods to see they've been running for some time. With a grunt, your guards step in front of thew newcomers, looking to inimidate them. Ever the deft orator, you wave them aside, assuring that there's nothing to worry about. One of the sweat-stained commoners nervously approaches, clearing his throat before he speaks. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], a terrible earthquake has devastated [r_province.GetNameNoTooltip]! People are desperately in need of aid. Families are still lost under the rubble, and countless homes have been destroyed!"
 ade.o.1: "The Army should flex their muscles and solve the problem. That's why they have them, no?"
 ade.ct.1: "The Army faction will get #N -10#! happiness"

 dfre.d.2: "You're attending a banquet with a bunch of nobles inside your royal villa. Everyone seems to be delighted, though the food and drink certainly ensure they stay that way! The morning passed blissfully and many nobles were quick to offer their congratulations on your recent economic reforms. The wealth they've brought to the state ensures that many more banquets will be held. Their praise is interrupted, however, as you notice your guards struggling to keep the front doors shut. Curious, you decide to inspect the scene and notice a crowd of commoners shoving the doors, desperate to try and enter. They cry out, desperately hoping to try the food whose scent has wafted over the walls. Yet all the spices in the world couldn't hide the scent of dirt and urine that envelops them. [n_leader.GetNameNoTooltipRegnal], the Leader of the Nobles, grimaces as he shakes his head. It's clear he'd rather keep them on the opposite side of the walls." 
 dfre.o.4: "They are humans too, they need to eat, and we have much to share."
 dfre.ct.4: "The Nobles faction will get #N -10#! happiness"
 dfre.o.5: "This is no place for a commoner, they would make my villa stink for months!"
 dfre.ct.5: "The Citizens faction will get #N -10#! happiness"
 dfre.d.3: "\"We did not pledge our loyalty to you, but to [ROOT.Char.GetName]!\" you hear shouting from your backyard. Curious as to what the fuss is about, you decide to investigate the commotion. There you find one of the commander's of your army arguing with a noble. The richly clad noble insists that he's only asking the commander and his soldiers to intimidate one of his rivals, nothing more. The commander, however, seems disgusted at the prospect of being treated as some common mercenary."
 dfre.o.6: "If there's enough coin, then what's the difference between army and mercenary?"
 dfre.o.7: "This is an inappropriate proposal! Intimidating rivals is work for simple mercenaries! Not the elite soldiers I employ!"
 dfre.ct.6: "The Nobles faction will get #P +5#! happiness"
 dfre.ct.7: "$ade.ct.1$\n$dfre.ct.6$"
 dfre.ct.8: "The Army faction will get #P +5#! happiness"
