 building_MA_pharos_alexandria_desc: "The Lighthouse of Pharos was built on the small island of Pharos by the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 280 and 247 BC to guide sailors safely into the busy harbor of Alexandria. Standing approximately 100 meters tall, it was one of the tallest man-made structures of the ancient world and a marvel of engineering. The lighthouse served as a prototype for all subsequent lighthouses and became a symbol of the city of Alexandria."
